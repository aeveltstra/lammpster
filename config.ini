; Configuration for Lammpster, a poster maker for profiles stored in
; the LAMMP database, maintained by the Trans Doe Task Force.
; 
; This configuration has [sections], each of which has 0 or more 
; fields. A field can be assigned a value. This is done using the = 
; symbol. A field name must start on the 1st column of a new line.
; The = symbol that assigns a value, must have a space in front and 
; following it.
; 
; Lines that start with a ; are comments, useful for explanations and
; examples. Disable a setting by placing a ; in front of its line.

; --------------------------------------------------------------------
; Tell Lammpster which spreadsheet and page inside of it to read.
[sheet]
; Provide the Google identifier of the spread sheet.
; The owner will need to share that spread sheet with the service 
; account identified below, in the account section. Have them use the 
; Share button above the spread sheet, and have them supply the email 
; address of the service acccount (specified in the account section, 
; below).  
google_drive_sheet_id = 1opYcLDkQC13Mvzu4YPqG2ZcH3hYUqcf4XWQWe0em2ac
; Provide the name of the page inside the spread sheet.
page_name = Missing
; Provide the number of the row that contains the column names.
; Numbering starts at 1. Usually it is row 1.
; This is used for instance when listing the sheet column names 
; separately, using the command-line option --list-column-names. 
page_column_names_row = 1

; --------------------------------------------------------------------
; Tell Lammpster which Google Service Account to use. 
; To set up the account, read this:
; https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials
; Review the Google Service Accounts in your Google Workspace Project 
; here:
; https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
; Enter the Manage Keys screen.
; Copy the JSON-formatted access key for the account from:
; Keys > Add key > Create new key.
; Select JSON, then click Create. The new file will be downloaded to
; your computer. Keep the key file outside of the project and do not 
; upload it to any publicly accessible code source vault.
; You will need to enable the Workspace Project for API Access. Give 
; the email address of this service account to the owner of the Google 
; Spread Sheet specified in the sheet section, above. They will need 
; to share their spread sheet with this service account.

[profile]
; Tell Lammpster which fields to expect from the profile data store.
; List them in the same order as they appear. With spread sheets,
; they appear as column headers next to each other. If using a spread
; sheet as the data store, list an empty header as the 1st one by 
; starting the list with a comma. Separate headers with commas.
; Do not omit any fields known to the data store.

; Tell Lammpster where to cache profiles. If none specified, no cache
; will be used. If cache is used, profile maker will look in this

; MUST NOT end in slash (/).

; --------------------------------------------------------------------
; Tell Lammpster how to map the profile fields to the placeholders in 
; the posters. You cannot specify any placeholder that is not in the 
; posters: rendering will fail. You may omit any placeholders found:
; rendering will succeed but the omitted placeholder will not be 
; substituted. You MUST wrap the = symbol in spaces, otherwise it 
; WILL FAIL. 
; Mapping format: placeholder = field name
; Mapping example: born = Birth Year
